# Valgus

A lightweight and easy-to-use framework for fast web development made with Go!

## Â¿Why?

Pretty much all the technologies that we use often in the web development world like React, Vue or Angular
are overkill for what we want to accomplish, so I made this tiny-tiny tool that allows you to make efficient and
compelling websites without a gazillion libraries behind. So if you are working on a lil project and don't want to
go nutz, use this.

## TODO's

- [x] Run an http server using the go `net/http` package.
- [x] Render an .html file using the go `html/template` package.
- [x] Make a `router.go` to handle all the incoming requests.
- [x] Implement error handling for non-existing pages.
- [x] Use `pugjs` as transpiler for `html`.
- [ ] Use `sass` as transpiler for `css`
- [ ] Create a welcome page with a little tutorial.
